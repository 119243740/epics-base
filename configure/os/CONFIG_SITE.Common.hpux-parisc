# NOTE for SHARED_LIBRARIES: If YES (which is the default now) then either
# a) SHLIB_PATH must include the full absolute pathname to
#    $(INSTALL_LOCATION)/lib/$(EPICS_HOST_ARCH) (or wherever you install
#    the EPICS shared libraries on your system) when invoking base
#    executables.
# b) Add the path to SHRLIB_SEARCH_DIRS below, which will burn
#    the runtime search path into the executables.
#SHARED_LIBRARIES=YES

# This is the absolute path to the generic INSTALL_LOCATION, for SHARED_LIBRARY searches.
