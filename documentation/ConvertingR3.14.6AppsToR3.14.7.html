<h2>Converting an EPICS R3.14.6 application to R3.14.7</h2>
</center>

<p>This document describes how to convert a R3.14.6 application so that it
builds with release R3.14.7.</p>


<h3>State Notation Compiler flags</h3>

<blockquote>
To make the run-time code reentrant, thus allowing more than one
instance of the state program to run on an IOC add the line  
"<name>_SNCFLAGS += +r" to the Makefile, replacing <name> with the
state notation language code file name.
</blockquote>

<h3>epicsExit</h3>
<p>Code that calls exit or atexit should change these calls to epicsExit
and epicsAtExit. epicsAtexit was created because of problems on
vxWorks and windows with the implementation of atexit,
i.e. neither of these systems implements exit and atexit according to the POSIX standard.</p>

<blockquote>
   Add the following lines 
#include "epicsExit.h"

epicsExit(0);

</blockquote>
