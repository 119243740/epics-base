<h1 align="center">EPICS Base Release 3.15.0.x</h1>

<p>
EPICS Base 3.15.0.x releases are not intended for use in production systems.</p>

<h2 align="center">Changes between 3.14.x and 3.15.0.x</h2>
<!-- Insert new items immediately below here ... -->

<h3>
Enabled histogram record type</h3>

<p>
The histogram record was not included in the base.dbd file in any 3.14 release,
but has now been added along with its associated soft device support.</p>

<h3>
Moved src/RTEMS/base directory</h3>

<p>
These files are now found under src/RTEMS.</p>

<h3>
Removed 3.13 compatibility</h3>

<p>
Removed the 3.13 &lt;top&gt;/config directory and build compatibility rules and
variables, and various conversion documents.</p>

<h3>
Added support for iocLogPrefix</h3>

<p>
Added a <code>iocLogPrefix</code> command to <code>ioCsh</code>. This establishes a prefix that will be
common to all log messages as they are sent to the iocLogServer. This lets us use the
"fac=&lt;<i>facility</i>&gt;" syntax for displaying the facility, process name etc. in log viewers like the
<code>cmlogviewer<code>.
