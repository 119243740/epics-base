<p>Description</p>

<h3>epicsTime API return status</h3>

<p>The epicsTime routines that used to return epicsTimeERROR now return a specific
S_time_ status value, allowing the caller to discover the reason for any failure.
The identifier <tt>epicsTimeERROR</tt> is no longer defined, so any references to
it in source code will no longer compile. The identifier epicsTimeOK still exists
and has the value 0 as before, so most code that uses these APIs can be changed in
a way that is backwards-compatible with the previous return status.</p>

<h3>Callback subsystem API</h3>

<p>Added a new macro <tt>callbackGetPriority(prio, callback)</tt> to the
callback.h header and removed the need for dbScan.c to reach into the internals
of its CALLBACK objects.</p>
