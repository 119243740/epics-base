  <title>EPICS Base R3.15.0.x Release Notes</title>
</head>

<body lang="en">
<h1 align="center">EPICS Base Release 3.15.0.x</h1>

<p>
EPICS Base 3.15.0.x releases are not intended for use in production systems.</p>

<h2 align="center">Changes between 3.14.x and 3.15.0.x</h2>
<!-- Insert new items immediately below here ... -->

<h4>epicsStdioRedirect.h merged into epicsStdio.h</h4>

<p>The definitions from the header file epicsStdioRedirect.h have been moved
into epicsStdio.h so all calls to printf(), puts() and putchar() in files that
include that OSI header will now be subject to stdout redirection.  In past
releases (3.14.7 and later) it was necessary to request the redirection support
by including the epicsStdioRedirect.h header file.  The header file is still
provided, but now it just includes epicsStdio.h.</p>

<h4>Named Soft Events</h4>

<p>Soft events can now be given meaningful names instead of just using the
numbers 1-255. The EVNT field is now a DBF_STRING. The <tt>post_event()</tt> API
is now deprecated but still works. It should be replaced by code that in advance
looks up the <tt>EVNTPVT</tt> event handle associated with the named event by
calling <tt>eventNameToHandle(char *)</tt>, and when that event occurs passes
that handle to the new <tt>postEvent(EVNTPVT)</tt> routine (which may be called
from interrupt level). A new iocsh command <tt>postEvent <i>name</i></tt> will
trigger a named event from the command-line or a startup script (on vxWorks the
expression <tt>postEvent(eventNameToHandle("<i>name</i>"))</tt> must be used
instead though).</p>

<h4>Parallel Builds</h4>

<p>
As EPICS sites get computers with more CPUs they report additional bugs in our
parallel build rules. Various issues have been fixed by separating out the build
rules that generate dependency (.d) files, ensuring that they are constructed at
the appropriate time in the build.</p>

<p>
These rule changes can cause additional warning messages to appear when building
support modules. Where an application provides its own Makefile rules it may now
have to add rules to construct an associated dependency file. In many cases
though the change needed is just to replace a dependency for a
<tt>target$(OBJ)</tt> with the <tt>target$(DEP)</tt> so this</p>

<pre>
    myLib$(OBJ): myLib_lex.c</pre>

<p>
becomes</p>

<pre>
    myLib$(DEP): myLib_lex.c</pre>

<p>
To debug build issues assocated with dependency files, use the command <tt>make
--debug=m</tt> which tells GNUmake to display information about what it is doing
during the first pass when it updates its makefiles.</p>

<h3>
Removed tsDefs.h</h3>

<p>
The deprecated tsDefs API was provided for 3.13 compatibility only, and has now
been removed.  Convert any remaining code that used it to call the epicsTime API
instead.</p>

<h3>
Changes to epicsVersion.h</h3>

<p>
The two macros <tt>EPICS_UPDATE_LEVEL</tt> and <tt>EPICS_CVS_SNAPSHOT</tt> have
been deleted from the epicsVersion.h file; they were deprecated in R3.14 and can
be replaced with <tt>EPICS_PATCH_LEVEL</tt> and <tt>EPICS_DEV_SNAPSHOT</tt>
respectively.</p>

<p>
A new pair of macros has been added to make version number comparisons easier.
Code that will not work with a version of Base before 3.15.0 can now be
written like this to prevent it from compiling:</p>

<pre style="margin: 0 2em;">
#if defined(VERSION_INT) && EPICS_VERSION_INT < VERSION_INT(3,15,0,0)
#  error EPICS Base R3.15.0 or later is required
#endif
</pre>

<h3>
Added support for iocLogPrefix</h3>

<p>
Added a <code>iocLogPrefix</code> command to <code>iocsh</code>. This adds a
prefix to all messages from this IOC (or other log client) as they get sent to the
iocLogServer. This lets sites use the "fac=&lt;<i>facility</i>&gt;" syntax for
displaying the facility, process name etc. in log viewers like the
<code>cmlogviewer<code>.</p>

<h3>
Reworked the epicsEvent C &amp; C++ APIs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Renamed the enum epicsEventWaitStatus to epicsEventStatus</li>
  <li>Defined epicsEventWaitStatus as a macro for epicsEventStatus</li>
  <li>Renamed epicsEventWaitOk to epicsEventOk</li>
  <li>Renamed epicsEventWaitError to epicsEventError</li>
  <li>Defined epicsEventWaitOK and epicsEventWaitError as macros</li>
  <li>Added epicsEventTrigger(id) which triggers an event and returns OK or an
    error status if the underlying OS primitives report an error</li>
  <li>Added epicsEventMustTrigger(id) which halts on error</li>
  <li>Defined epicsEventSignal(id) as a macro for epicsEventMustTrigger(id)</li>
  <li>Added a new C++ method epicsEvent::trigger() which throws an
    epicsEvent::invalidSemaphore in the event of an error</li>
  <li>epicsEvent::signal() makes an inline call to epicsEvent::trigger()</li>
  <li>epicsEventWait() and epicsEventWaitWithTimeout() now return an error
    status if the underlying OS primitives report an error</li>
  <li>All the epicsEventMust...() routines are now implemented in the common
    libCom/osi/epicsEvent.cpp source file, and call cantProceed() instead of
    mis-using assert()</li>
  <li>Implemented epicsEventShow() on Posix</li>
  <li>Win32: Removed all epicsShareAPI decorations</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Enabled histogram record type</h3>

<p>
The histogram record was not included in the base.dbd file in any 3.14 release,
but has now been added along with its associated soft device support. The build
system now generates the list of all the record.dbd files in base automatically
in src/std/rec/Makefile.</p>

<h3>
Reorganization of src/</h3>

<p>Reorganization of subdirectories of src/ to better represent the relation
between different parts as described in the following table.</p>

<p>This change also allows the number of libraries built to be reduced to:
libCap5.so,  libca.so,   libdbCore.so,    libdbStaticHost.so,
libCom.so,   libcas.so,  libdbRecStd.so, and  libgdd.so</p>

<p><a name="rsrv">1</a>
RSRV is built as part of dbCore due to its tight (bidirectional) coupling
with the other database code.</p>

<p><a name="util">2</a>
The contents for src/util/ moved to three locations.  The caRepeater init script
was moved to src/ca/client/.  ca_test is now in src/ca/client/test/.
The iocLogServer was moved into the same directory (src/libCom/log) as
the log client code.</p>

<p><a name="as">3</a>
The Access Security code has been divided, with the parts not related to the 
database (lexer/parser and trap registration) becoming part of libCom.
The remaining components are included in the dbCore library</p>

<h3>
Moved src/RTEMS/base directory</h3>

<p>
These files are now found under src/RTEMS.</p>

<h3>
Removed 3.13 compatibility</h3>

<p>
Removed the 3.13 &lt;top&gt;/config directory and build compatibility rules and
variables, and various conversion documents.</p>
