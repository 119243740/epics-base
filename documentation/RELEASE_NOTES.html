  <title>EPICS Base R3.15.0.1 Release Notes</title>
</head>

<body lang="en">
<h1 align="center">EPICS Base Release 3.15.0.1</h1>

<p>
EPICS Base 3.15.0.x releases are not intended for use in production systems.</p>

<h2 align="center">Changes between 3.15.0.1 and 3.15.0.2</h2>
<!-- Insert new items immediately below here ... -->

<h3>Deleted Java build rules</h3>

<p>Java has its own build systems now, so we've deleted the rules and associated
variables from Base, although they might get added to the Extensions build rules
for a while in case anyone still needs them.</p>

<h2 align="center">Changes between 3.14.x and 3.15.0.1</h2>

<h3>MSI included with Base</h3>

<p>An enhanced version of the Macro Substitution and Include program <q>msi</q>
has been included with Base. Both this new version of msi and the IOC's
<tt>dbLoadTemplates</tt> command now support setting global macros in
substitution files, and <tt>dbLoadTemplates</tt> can now take a list of global
macro settings as the second argument on its command line. The substitution file
syntax is documented in the Application Developers Guide.</p>

<h3>Cross-builds targeting win32-x86-mingw</h3>

<p>Some Linux distributions now package the MinGW cross-compiler which makes it
possible to cross-build the win32-x86-mingw target from a linux-x86 host. Build
configuration files for this combination are now included; adjust the settings
in configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.linux-x86.win32-x86-mingw and add win32-x86-mingw to
the CROSS_COMPILER_TARGET_ARCHS variable in configure/CONFIG_SITE or in
configure/os/CONFIG_SITE.linux-x86.Common.</p>

<h3>Architecture win32-x86-cygwin Removed</h3>

<p>The ability to compile non-cygwin binaries using the Cygwin build tools is no
longer supported by current versions of Cygwin, so this architecture has been
removed. Use the MinWG tools and the win32-x86-mingw architecture instead.</p>

<h3>RTEMS and VxWorks Test Harnesses</h3>

<p>The original libCom test harness has been renamed <tt>libComTestHarness</tt>,
and two additional test harnesses have been created <tt>dbTestHarness</tt> and
<tt>filterTestHarness</tt> which are all built for RTEMS and vxWorks targets.
The new ones include tests in src/ioc/db/test and src/std/filters/test.</p>

<p>Running the new tests requires additional .db and .dbd files to be loaded at
runtime, which can be found in the relevant source directory or its O.Common
subdirectory. If the target can access the Base source tree directly it may be
simplest to cd to the relevant source directory before running the test. If not,
the files needed are listed in the generated 'testspec' file found in the
associated build (O.<i>arch</i>) directory.</p>

<p>For RTEMS users the current directory is determined in a BSP specific way.
See rtems_init.c and setBootConfigFromNVRAM.c in src/libCom/RTEMS.</p>

<h3>New API to hook into thread creation</h3>

<p>A hook API has been added allowing user-supplied functions to be called
whenever a thread starts. The calls are made from the thread's context,
and can be used to control additional thread properties not handled inside
EPICS base, e.g. setting the scheduling policy or CPU affinity (on SMP
systems).</p>

<p>The API also supports a mapping operation, calling a user-supplied function
for every thread that is currently running.</p>

<h3>New scan rate units</h3>

<p>Scan rates defined in the menuScan.dbd file may now be specified in seconds,
minutes, hours or Hertz, and plural time units will also be accepted (seconds
are used if no unit is mentioned in the choice string). At <tt>iocInit</tt> each
scan rate is compared with the OS's clock tick and a warning printed if the
rate is too fast or likely to be more than 10% different to the requested rate.
For example the rates given below are all valid, although non-standard (the
default menuScan choices that come with Base have not been changed):</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>menu(menuScan) {
    choice(menuScanPassive,     "Passive")
    choice(menuScanEvent,       "Event")
    choice(menuScanI_O_Intr,    "I/O Intr")
    choice(menuScan1_hour,      "1 hour")
    choice(menuScan0_5_hours, "0.5 hours")
    choice(menuScan15_minutes, "15 minutes")
    choice(menuScan5_minutes,   "5 minutes")
    choice(menuScan1_minute,    "1 minute")
    choice(menuScan10_seconds, "10 seconds")
    choice(menuScan5_seconds,   "5 seconds")
    choice(menuScan2_seconds,   "2 seconds")
    choice(menuScan1_second,    "1 second")
    choice(menuScan2_Hertz,     "2 Hertz")
    choice(menuScan5_Hertz,     "5 Hertz")
    choice(menuScan10_Hertz,   "10 Hz")
}</pre></blockquote>

<h3>Alarm filtering added to input record types</h3>

<p>The record types ai, calc, longin and mbbi have a new alarm filter added to
them. This provides a low-pass filter that can be used to delay the reporting of
alarms caused by the input level passing the HIGH, HIHI, LOW or LOLO values. The
filter is controlled with a new AFTC field that sets the filter's time constant.
The default value for this field is zero, which keeps the record's original
alarm behaviour.</p>

<p>The record must be scanned often enough for the filtering action to work
effectively and the alarm severity can only change when the record is processed,
but that processing does not have to be regular; the filter uses the time since
the record last processed in its calculation. Setting AFTC to a positive number
of seconds will delay the record going into or out of a minor alarm severity or
from minor to major severity until the input signal has been in that range for
that number of seconds.</p>

<h3>Post events on Waveform record's NORD field</h3>

<p>When the record type or soft device support modify the NORD field of a
waveform record they now also post a DBE_VALUE and DBE_LOG event, signalling the
array length change to any clients monitoring the NORD field.  Input device
support routines should be modified to do this as well.</p>

<h3>Attributes of Non-VAL Fields</h3>

<p>Non-VAL fields now report meaningful information for precision, units,
graphic limits, control limits, and alarm limits instead of simply using
PREC, EGU, HOPR, LOPR, DRVL, DRVH, HIHI, HIGH, LOW, and LOLO. All delay
fields have a default precision of 2 digits, units "s" and control limits
of 0 to 100,000 seconds (these precision and limit values can be changed
for each record type as a whole at runtime by updating a registered global
variable). Input fields like A-L of the calc record read their metadata
from the corresponding INPn link if possible.</p>
<h4>epicsStdioRedirect.h merged into epicsStdio.h</h4>

<p>The definitions from the header file epicsStdioRedirect.h have been moved
into epicsStdio.h so all calls to printf(), puts() and putchar() in files that
include that OSI header will now be subject to stdout redirection.  In past
releases (3.14.7 and later) it was necessary to request the redirection support
by including the epicsStdioRedirect.h header file.  The header file is still
provided, but now it just includes epicsStdio.h.</p>

<h4>Named Soft Events</h4>

<p>Soft events can now be given meaningful names instead of just using the
numbers 1-255. The EVNT field is now a DBF_STRING. The <tt>post_event()</tt> API
is now deprecated but still works. It should be replaced by code that in advance
looks up the <tt>EVNTPVT</tt> event handle associated with the named event by
calling <tt>eventNameToHandle(char *)</tt>, and when that event occurs passes
that handle to the new <tt>postEvent(EVNTPVT)</tt> routine (which may be called
from interrupt level). A new iocsh command <tt>postEvent <i>name</i></tt> will
trigger a named event from the command-line or a startup script (on vxWorks the
expression <tt>postEvent(eventNameToHandle("<i>name</i>"))</tt> must be used
instead though).</p>

<h4>Parallel Builds</h4>

<p>
As EPICS sites get computers with more CPUs they report additional bugs in our
parallel build rules. Various issues have been fixed by separating out the build
rules that generate dependency (.d) files, ensuring that they are constructed at
the appropriate time in the build.</p>

<p>
These rule changes can cause additional warning messages to appear when building
support modules. Where an application provides its own Makefile rules it may now
have to add rules to construct an associated dependency file. In many cases
though the change needed is just to replace a dependency for a
<tt>target$(OBJ)</tt> with the <tt>target$(DEP)</tt> so this</p>

<pre>
    myLib$(OBJ): myLib_lex.c</pre>

<p>
becomes</p>

<pre>
    myLib$(DEP): myLib_lex.c</pre>

<p>
To debug build issues assocated with dependency files, use the command <tt>make
--debug=m</tt> which tells GNUmake to display information about what it is doing
during the first pass when it updates its makefiles.</p>

<h3>
Removed tsDefs.h</h3>

<p>
The deprecated tsDefs API was provided for 3.13 compatibility only, and has now
been removed.  Convert any remaining code that used it to call the epicsTime API
instead.</p>

<h3>
Changes to epicsVersion.h</h3>

<p>
The two macros <tt>EPICS_UPDATE_LEVEL</tt> and <tt>EPICS_CVS_SNAPSHOT</tt> have
been deleted from the epicsVersion.h file; they were deprecated in R3.14 and can
be replaced with <tt>EPICS_PATCH_LEVEL</tt> and <tt>EPICS_DEV_SNAPSHOT</tt>
respectively.</p>

<p>
A new pair of macros has been added to make version number comparisons easier.
Code that will not work with a version of Base before 3.15.0 can now be
written like this to prevent it from compiling:</p>

<pre style="margin: 0 2em;">
#if defined(VERSION_INT) && EPICS_VERSION_INT < VERSION_INT(3,15,0,0)
#  error EPICS Base R3.15.0 or later is required
#endif
</pre>

<h3>
Added support for iocLogPrefix</h3>

<p>
Added a <code>iocLogPrefix</code> command to <code>iocsh</code>. This adds a
prefix to all messages from this IOC (or other log client) as they get sent to the
iocLogServer. This lets sites use the "fac=&lt;<i>facility</i>&gt;" syntax for
displaying the facility, process name etc. in log viewers like the
<code>cmlogviewer</code>.</p>

<h3>
Reworked the epicsEvent C &amp; C++ APIs</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Renamed the enum epicsEventWaitStatus to epicsEventStatus</li>
  <li>Defined epicsEventWaitStatus as a macro for epicsEventStatus</li>
  <li>Renamed epicsEventWaitOk to epicsEventOk</li>
  <li>Renamed epicsEventWaitError to epicsEventError</li>
  <li>Defined epicsEventWaitOK and epicsEventWaitError as macros</li>
  <li>Added epicsEventTrigger(id) which triggers an event and returns OK or an
    error status if the underlying OS primitives report an error</li>
  <li>Added epicsEventMustTrigger(id) which halts on error</li>
  <li>Defined epicsEventSignal(id) as a macro for epicsEventMustTrigger(id)</li>
  <li>Added a new C++ method epicsEvent::trigger() which throws an
    epicsEvent::invalidSemaphore in the event of an error</li>
  <li>epicsEvent::signal() makes an inline call to epicsEvent::trigger()</li>
  <li>epicsEventWait() and epicsEventWaitWithTimeout() now return an error
    status if the underlying OS primitives report an error</li>
  <li>All the epicsEventMust...() routines are now implemented in the common
    libCom/osi/epicsEvent.cpp source file, and call cantProceed() instead of
    mis-using assert()</li>
  <li>Implemented epicsEventShow() on Posix</li>
  <li>Win32: Removed all epicsShareAPI decorations</li>
</ul>

<h3>
Enabled histogram record type</h3>

<p>
The histogram record was not included in the base.dbd file in any 3.14 release,
but has now been added along with its associated soft device support. The build
system now generates the list of all the record.dbd files in base automatically
in src/std/rec/Makefile.</p>

<h3>
Reorganization of src/</h3>

<p>Reorganization of subdirectories of src/ to better represent the relation
between different parts as described in the following table.</p>

<p>This change also allows the number of libraries built to be reduced to:
libCap5.so,  libca.so,   libdbCore.so,    libdbStaticHost.so,
libCom.so,   libcas.so,  libdbRecStd.so, and  libgdd.so</p>

<p><a name="rsrv">1</a>
RSRV is built as part of dbCore due to its tight (bidirectional) coupling
with the other database code.</p>

<p><a name="util">2</a>
The contents for src/util/ moved to three locations.  The caRepeater init script
was moved to src/ca/client/.  ca_test is now in src/ca/client/test/.
The iocLogServer was moved into the same directory (src/libCom/log) as
the log client code.</p>

<p><a name="as">3</a>
The Access Security code has been divided, with the parts not related to the 
database (lexer/parser and trap registration) becoming part of libCom.
The remaining components are included in the dbCore library</p>

<h3>
Moved src/RTEMS/base directory</h3>

<p>
These files are now found under src/RTEMS.</p>

<h3>
Removed 3.13 compatibility</h3>

<p>
Removed the 3.13 &lt;top&gt;/config directory and build compatibility rules and
variables, and various conversion documents.</p>
