Virtual LINAC Demo

The Virtual LINAC Demo is an EPICS ioc application that simulates
an electron beam progressing down a LINAC. Several steering coils,
BPMs, and other typical accelerator components are simulated.
See Virtual_Linac_Info.pdf for a complete explanation.

For full functionality the sequencer module and a two
sequence programs must be built and loaded. The raw template
has these items commented out because the sequencer is not
part of base. The following steps must be accomplished:
  - Uncomment the SNCSEQ definition line in
    configure/RELEASE and define the link to the location
    where the sequencer was installed.

  - Rebuild the entire application and start (reboot) the ioc

This directory (misc) contains additional files to compliment
the virtual linac demo application.

To start the ioc, refer to the README file in the iocBoot 
directory.

To start medm, use the following command:
medm -local -x -macro user=_USER_ Virtual_Linac.adl
