Booting IOCs and startup files

For Systems that do not support soft links the following is necessary

The boot parameters must contain:

file name     : <full path namevxWorks>
startup script: <full path name to startup script>

For example

file name     :home/phoebus/MRK/examplePerl/bin/mv167/vxWorks
startup script:home/phoebus/MRK/examplePerl/iocBoot/iocexample/st.cmd

The st.cmd file must be of the form:

cd "<full path name to ioc directory>"
...

dbLoadDatabase("../../dbd/<xxx>App.dbd")
dbLoadRecords("../../xxxApp/Db/xxx.db")
...

For systems that do support soft links the following is possible

The boot parameters can be:

file name     :/home/phoebus/MRK/examplePerl/iocBoot/iocexample/vxWorks
startup script:st.cmd

The st.cmd file can be of the form:

cd "<full path name to ioc directory>"
...
 
dbLoadDatabase("dbd/<xxx>App.dbd")
dbLoadRecords("xxxApp/Db/xxx.db")


In addition if the APS board support mods are in effect the cd command
is not necessary.

If NFS is desired then:
