This is the regular GNU flex that has had its skeleton file munged with in
order to force it to build lex programs that have all their functions and 
variables defined as static.  Some of the files in this directory were 
generated by the flex distribution itself.  They probably should have been
made into earlyTarget() macros in the Imakefiles, but it was easier to
simply generate them and check them into SCCS, because they will never change.

The file in Unix/share/sun4/toolsComm/flex/flex.skel.static is simply
a copy of flex.skel that has been altered to make all the components into
static variables.

In order to be able to actually use the lex files produced by this flavor of
flex, you must #include them into your C programs.  Otherwise they will
be uncallable (all functions are static.)  This is typical of lex programs
that are used by yacc programs anyway.  Often a yacc program file will
#include the lex-generated C-file anyway.
