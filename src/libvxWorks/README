bus_error_recovery.c: code written for Frank to recover from bus error
 when he uses bus extenders.  Frank's bus error code.  I checked this
 into base/src/libvxWorks as bus_error_recovery.c.  This is the
 program I wrote for Frank to catch bus errors and retry them.  He was
 getting random bus error through the MXI/VXI bus extenders and this
 could recover from those problems.
