This directory contains an example ca server. The example server
exports 4 process variables (PVs): "fred", "freddy", "jane", and
"janet". "fred" and "jane" are synchronous PVs. "freddy" and "janet" 
are asynchronous. Many ca servers will find that synchronous 
variables will meet there needs and therefore will not require
the increased complexity associated with asynchronous PVs. The PVs in
the example server are updated periodically. Some random "noise"
is added to each PVs current value each time that it is updated.

The example server does not so far implement enumerated data types.
