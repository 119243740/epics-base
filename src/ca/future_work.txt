Potential upgrades to Channel Access

o specify max channel count when initializing CA?
This would allow a better hash table size allocation.

o generalized access to abstract data
o use multicast for broadcasting and ax the repeater
o large arrays
o improve client API
o improve security
o name service (wildcard queries)
o PV name prefix (for all PVs)
o client access to process passive and for maximize severity
o detect name conflicts at boot time
o multi priority connections (quality of service)
o reduce protocol overhead
o compressed protocol


o If there is a beacon anomaly then this indicates that
the server is _not_ available. Perhaps we should only
reset the search timer interval when we see a beacon 
anomaly transition into a sure steady beacon.

o make certain that a monitor callback canceling itself
does not deadlock.

o the free list library does not now cause exceptions to
occur (it uses new ( nothrow )), and therefore we should
change the new handlers to be nothrow also if this is 
the design goal.

o test the library when an IOC is running low on memory.
