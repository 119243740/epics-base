<h2>vxWorks TIMEZONE pentium</h2>

<p>If the name of the timezone has more than a few characters a crash can
occur on pentium vxWorks iocs. See ansiTime in the vxWorks reference manual
for details about TIMEZONE.</p>

<h2>epicsReadLine</h2>

<p>src/libCom/osi/os/default/epicsReadline.c used a char variable to hold the
return value from getc(), and compared this against EOF. getc() returns int
not char because ANSI C allows char to be unsigned if the architecture finds
that easier, thus EOF can never be stored in a char on a PowerPC CPU. char
should be changed to int or signed char.</p>

<h2>RTEMS and NTP</h2>

<p>The RTEMS startup routine waits until a time synchronization packet is
received from an NTP server.  This causes the RTEMS intialization to loop
endlessly if there is no NTP server on the network.
This problem has been fixed in the CVS version by allowing the initialization
to time out after a minute or so and to set the IOC time to January 1, 2001.</p>
